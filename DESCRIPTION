Title: Read MapBox Vector Tiles From a GeoServer
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Bradley W. Compton
Maintainer: Bradley W. Compton <bcompton@umass.edu>
Description: Read tiled vector data in Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT) from a 
	GeoServer and return as 'sf' objects. This package is intended to 
	be used with 'leaflet' under 'shiny' with multiple users, though it
	is expected to work fine in other applications that are probably 
	less demanding. Caches and shares served data among 'shiny' users 
	on a session, and avoids unnecessary redrawing in 'leaflet'. This
	approach supports displaying very large vector datasets in tiles
	that follow zooming and panning.
