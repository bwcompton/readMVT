Landscape connectivity is vital to the long-term survival of plant and animal populations. At varying scales, connectivity is necessary for feeding, migration, mating, genetic diversity, and dispersal to new areas. As climate change alters habitat, species will be forced to alter their ranges, dispersing great distances over generations. Where connectivity is broken by unsuitable habitat, development, and roads, populations may face extinction. Our models of regional connectivity inform conservationists reconnecting the landscape in the Northeast.

We start the analysis by selecting points with high ecological integrity in a 2 km grid. These points are connected to other points within 5 km based on development, road traffic, and ecological similarity to each starting point, yielding paths that represent local connectivity. We then count the number of times each path is used in connecting each pair of points across the entire Northeast, and use this to weight local connectivity, resulting in models of regional connectivity that are

* Truly regional: rather than chaining local or medium-scale connectivity, this approach assesses paths hundreds of miles long, from Virginia to Maine
* Multi-scale: connectivity is assessed at multiple scales, so results are meaningful for a town, a state, or the entire Northeast
* Ecosystem-aware: rather than simply connecting natural systems, connectivity is estimated for forests or wetlands or even finer groups such as ridgetop forests or floodplain forests, and paths are based on ecological similarity to the target systems
* Independent of pre-defined conservation targets: rather than connecting existing or aspirational conservation cores, all of the landscape is connected, so conservation targets may be brought in later in the planning process or omitted entirely

Regional connectivity can be used to assess the level of connectivity among existing conservation land, and to target additional land to conserve connectivity, including "unlovely" land important for connectivity that might not otherwise be protected. It can also be used to assess viable locations for wildlife road passages, and it highlights bridges that already provide connectivity under high-traffic roads.
